Welcome to WeatherTop 2 App

A small app for recording data from Weather Stations
Users can:

Register and create an account
Add and Delete Stations View Stations and see latest readings
Edit and delete stations & readings
Site is deployed globally on heroku at https://weathertopversion2.herokuapp.com

Sources: Various labs and lecture videos from Web Development II module from semester 1.5 of the SETU Higher Diploma in Computer Science 
W3Schools for information on using the built in Date() function to create timestamps for the station readings

Bugs:

In order for methods in 'station-analytics.js' to not cause an error there must be at least 1 station reading preloaded into the station User cannot edit personal details but I left the icon in place as I want to try and develop the application further as I advance my abilities
